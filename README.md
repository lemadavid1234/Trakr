# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Trakr

**Trakr** is a personal fitness workout tracker that allows users to log their workouts, monitor their progress, and receive AI-powered fitness suggestions. This project also serves as a hands-on learning experience in full-stack web development.

## üéØ Purpose

This app is being built as a way to **learn and practice full-stack web development**, focusing on modern tools and technologies used in real-world applications. As development progresses, the app will integrate both core features (workout logging, data visualization) and advanced AI tools for dynamic fitness advice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Tech        | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **React**   | Frontend UI with component-based architecture |
| **Firebase**| User authentication and hosting (possibly Firestore for simple data storage) |
| **MongoDB** | NoSQL database for storing detailed workout logs (if not using Firestore) |
| **Node.js + Express** | API server to handle requests between frontend and database |
| **OpenAI API** | Used to provide smart workout suggestions and plan edits |

## üöß Features (In Progress)

- [ ] User signup/login (Firebase Auth)
- [ ] Workout logger (date, exercises, sets, reps, notes)
- [ ] Progress history view
- [ ] Ask AI: "Improve my workout"
- [ ] AI-suggested routines based on goals

## üìö Learning Goals

- Build and deploy a full-stack web application from scratch
- Understand component-based development using React
- Learn backend integration using Node.js and MongoDB
- Explore Firebase Auth and cloud tools
- Experiment with AI integration using OpenAI's API
